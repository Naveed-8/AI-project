Building an Autocorrect Feature

Problem Statement:
Autocorrect is the saving grace for us all (sometimes). The number of times I’ve gone to type a message and it would come out as if I don’t know how to spell a word then autocorrect intercedes on my behalf. To define Autocorrect more formally, it is a software function that suggests or makes corrections for spelling or grammatical errors automatically whilst we type.


In the past two years smart phones have transformed (and some would say mangled) the English language with their autocorrect suggestions. They now suggest and automatically replace words as you type them. As you may have experienced, this can lead to some very serious miscommunication. So, to avoid this problem, the Autocorrect model is programmed to correct spellings and errors while inputting text and locating the most comparable related words. With the context of machine learning, autocorrect is completely based on natural language processing. As the name suggests it is programmed to correct spellings and errors while typing. It compares the words in the vocabulary dictionary and the typed words on the keyboard.

Objective of this Project is to build an autocorrect feature which is an implementation of the Natural Language Processing on a smaller dataset like a book. When a word is entered on the keyboard then this feature should identify the misspelled word, find the words that are closer to the typed word from the dictionary then the filtering of the words found should be done based on word probabilities to pick the most-likely correct word.
